# Burger Time

### What is Burger Time?
Burger Time is a restaurant app that allows patrons to track the burgers that they would like to eat and that they've eaten. Users can input the names of the burgers that they would like to eat. By default,the app will assume that the patron has not yet devoured the burger and will display it under the "Burgers that have NOT been devoured!" section of the app. The patron can then choose to delete the burger (if they inputted it incorrectly) or devour it. Once a burger is devoured, it will appear in the "Burgers that have been devoured!" section. 

This app is built using express, handlebars, MYSQL, javascript, bootstrap and CSS.
