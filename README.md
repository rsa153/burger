# Burger Time

### What is Burger Time?
Burger Time is a restaurant app that allows patrons to track the burgers that they would like to eat and that they've eaten. Users can input the names of the burgers that they would like to eat. By default,the app will assume that the patron has not yet devoured the burger and will display it under the "Burgers to devour" section of the app. The patron can devour the burger and once the burger is devoured, it will appear in the "Devoured Burgers" section. After the burger is devoured, the patron can then delete the devoured burger from the app.

This app is built using express, handlebars, MYSQL, javascript, bootstrap and CSS.
